- Perform Basic Nmap Scans
# Scenario
A Wireshark capture shows unusual activity on a machine on the 10.6.6.0 DMZ network. You’ve been asked to do some active recon on the machine to determine what services it may be offering and if there are vulnerable applications that could present security issues. The IP address of the suspicious computer is 10.6.6.23. You have access to a Kali Linux system on the 10.6.6.0 network.
