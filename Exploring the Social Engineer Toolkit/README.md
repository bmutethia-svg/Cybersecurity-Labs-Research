Many exploits begin with a social engineering attack that is designed to obtain credentials or plant malware to create entry points into the target network. One of the tools used to perform these social engineering attacks is the Social Engineer Toolkit (SET), developed by David Kennedy.
- Launching SET and exploring the toolkit
- Cloning a website to obtain user credentials
- Capturing and viewing user credentials
